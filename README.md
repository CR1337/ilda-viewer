# Ilda Viewer

This web application displays ILDA files in the browser. 

You can load an ILDA file from your computer and view all animations it contains. View it in **2D** or **3D**. There is also a **Debug** view that shows the beams entire travel path, even when it is blanked. 

The application lets you choose between **Animation** and and **Frame by Frame** mode. In **Animation** mode you can also choose the frames per second.

Try it out at [cr1337.github.io/ilda-viewer](https://cr1337.github.io/ilda-viewer).

## Contribution

I would like to add a shader to make the 3D view look more like a real laser projection. If you want to give it a try, feel free to fork the project and submit a pull request. ðŸ™‚
